# Rock, Paper, Ninja

Rock, Paper, Ninja is an example Game I Made just to fiddle with Python's Kivy.
It creates a window with a picture of a ninja plus 3 buttons (Rock,Paper,Scissors)

When you choose a button it will generate a random choice and compare it to yours to determine the winner.

At the moment the app just shows an image if you win, lose or tie.

Future versions will incorporate animations (video) sounds, proper windows resizing, text transformations etc...  and then an android port of the "game"

## Requirements

Kivy needs to be installed for the app to run.

`pip install kivy`
